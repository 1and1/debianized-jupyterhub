# JupyterHub 0.9.5 Debian Packaging

Besides the necessary updates due to a Open Redirect vulnerability,
this release comes with a configuration example for SSL off-loading
with NginX, configurable banner image, and Tornado 6.

The Python3 kernel now has plotly_express, colorcet, networkx, and
jupyter-contrib-nbextensions pre-installed.

Enjoy!

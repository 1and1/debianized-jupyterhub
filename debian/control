Description: Debian packaging of Jupyterhub, a multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks.
    .
    This is a self-contained Python virtualenv wrapped into a Debian package
    (an "omnibus" package, all passengers on board). The packaged virtualenv
    is kept in sync with the host's interpreter automatically.
